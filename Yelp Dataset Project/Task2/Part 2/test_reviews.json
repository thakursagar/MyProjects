Must be hard times for these guys because the interior appears to be older than what they had when they were on the other side of the street.   That place now sits empty.

What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.My friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.The negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  If it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

Many places take advantage of the simplicity by rushing things along.  You end up with edible but uninspired eats.  Though my breakfast arrived shortly after it was ordered, it was cooked properly and with care.  My sunny side up eggs were perfectly done, the whites well set and the yolks warm but properly runny.  The four large slices of bacon were thick and flavorful.  I ordered the hash-browns crispy, and that's how they came.  Everything on the plate was cooked just right and tasted super good.  I could almost like eating breakfast out, if every place served breakfast like this.Service was fast and friendly.  Coffee was the usual diner style, weak and plentiful.  The bar looked capable of producing a solid bloody mary, but alas this went untested.  Prices were as cheap as the day is long.

I have never come away unimpressed with either the food or the service.  I can't really speak to authenticity since I wouldn't really know it if I saw it, but for what they do Mi Cocina does it well.  All I do know is that I have gotten my favorites here over and over without ever having any problems.  The staff is always friendly and fast which sets the place apart from several other area restaurants of the genre.  If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3.5 - 4 stars.  Last time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side.  It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.  The prices are quite reasonable and given the amount of food always a good deal.  Mi Cocina probably won't ever be held up as a paragon of the style, but it has always been reliable and enjoyable and for that I'll keep coming back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "77ESrCo7hQ96VpCWWdvoxg"}

The waiter brought us chips and salsa immediately, and then took our drink orders.  Within a few minutes, our sodas arrived, along with a cheese dip.  We quickly scarfed down the salsa and cheese dip; the salsa was initially mild but then had a nice little kick to it at the end.  The chips were a thicker cut chip; they weren't the slightest bit greasy.  The queso was excellent - nice and hearty, white cheese, delicious.  We ordered our entrees and within minutes our food was available.  There was a slight mix-up with my order - I had requested chicken burritos but received beef.  No big deal; the beef burritos were decent - some chunks of potato were an interesting touch.  My dining partner ordered a sampler plate, which came with a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a tamale.  It was good as well; the chicken was far better than the ground beef.  Service was beyond excellent - very fast, very attentive, and as such, we left a nice tip.  Only complaints?  A tad pricey - our meal was $26 without any beers/margaritas, and there were a ton of kids in there, which was a bit distracting.

The guacamole (not the tableside-made) is bland and pasty.  I ordered a pollo ensalada (chicken salad), which arrived as a bowl of super watery iceburg lettuce, a slab of seared chicken breast, 4 small slices of cucumber, a spoonful of pico de gallo, and a huge glob of guacamole (which I scraped off and set aside).  The salad was ok, but as I neared the end, I literally had what looked like a small soup bowl's worth of water resting in the bottom.    My coworker's entrees were drenched in various cheese sauces/red sauces; the taco combo was blanketed in cheese.  They loved it, but my guts would've been complaining for days.   So, enjoy the new location and ambiance - just don't expect better food.  Those who've had real Mexican food will not enjoy this place.

A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag.  This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing.     Lamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12.95. It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite, though the lamb was tender and cooked well.  The overall dish was very very salty with no special taste.  Just a little spicy, a little Indian, and a little lamb.  They are probably using curry paste from a jar, or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor (besides salt).  A whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge, which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite.  Rice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits.  I just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant.  Rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there.  If the rice has been sitting for too long, throw it out and make more.    I tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb Saag rehydrated the rice somewhat, and the rice's absorption of the Saag took away some of its saltiness.

Office employees flock to Wild Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring a few close friends or relatives back at night or on the weekend to share their secret.  The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious.    The food is where the adventure begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger.  The soup is a concert of spicy hot lemony flavors that leave you wanting more.  Don't fret, you can always order more to go. Dragon's Eggs are paramount on our list of favorite's starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, nestled in fresh vegetables and comes with a seasoned dipping sauce.   The Lunch and dinner menu is delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit.  Order hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  If you want  more curry ,  spicier  or  hotter  you only need to ask.   Desert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious and contagious.  Drink hints: A nice compliment to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea.   It is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave the open kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  She is the heart of The Wild Thaiger.  As Marcial and I leave and thank her for another wonderful meal, her gracious smile, hands clasps and graceful bow, keeps us coming back.  Note:  METRO Lightrail construction has impacted this restaurant and you need to follow construction signs carefully to navigate the street and driveway to Wild Thaiger.  Drive slow, this Tiger is worth hunting in the concrete jungle.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

Of hearing about it, finally, we decided to walk over and pick up some food. then I read some of the yelp reviews and almost changed my mind. The reviews were pretty bad: several reports of poor service and the -the most alarmingly one of all - pointing out how bland and flavorless the food was. also, there were descriptions of it being a cool baby type place with haughty staff and incompetent servers. Did the tempe pita jungle servers moonlight at wild thaiger? I was surprised because all the times I drove past it - before realizing how popular it was - I thought it looked typical of a thai/asian place. The name was silly and cheesy, and the giant purple banner that takes up almost the entire front of the unsuspecting cinderblock rest. has just the eyes of a tiger staring at you from their very purple perch. How can this place possibly be too-cool? I checked out their web site (which I was surprised to find they had one as this place looks pretty hole-in-the-wall) so we could order ahead and walk to pick it up. the site was pretty slow and I almost gave up, but I was pretty stoked on the options and the prices. Grilled peanut chicken? Sounds great. Spicy chicken curry, I'll take it. tiger prawn salad, ok. All for about $8?? Sounds pretty reasonable. I went with the curry chicken and the spring roll (all lunch items come with either soup of the day or the roll - unless your taking out, as they won't/can't do soup to go.) Off we went and when we walked up I was surprised to find that the ramada-like, large patio with high walls and iron bars took up the entire front of the building. We had to search around for the hidden entrance. Once inside it was busy with a downtown business casual crowd, but a scurrying waitress still held the door and asked if we wanted a table (for the record she was not in skinny jeans, flats and sporting tons of eyeliner and a fauxhawk, as I figured she would be).  We walked up to the bar to collect our food and pay, and the lively atmosphere made me sad we were going back to the office and not eating there. the bar area had a flat screen tv, there was lively if a little over-the-top Asian pop music, and the healthy crowd was a nice change of pace. Alas, we were in and out (they were not even put out by our asking to split up the to go order so we could each pay separately, even though they were obviously busy) in under 10 minutes. The food stayed pretty hot for the 15 minute walk back, and they double bagged each Styrofoam box -thank god, as half my curry sauce came out of the box. It smelled great and the veggies looked good, but I braced myself for disappointment. Perhaps because I was expecting it to be bad, I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. Mine was just enough spicy as is (for me, though and I'm a wuss - so If you're into hot-hot-hot, ask to punch it up a notch or three) and the serving was plenty for the price. The veggie spring roll was great - not even soggy from the trip, how did that happen? I think the curry sauce was a little thin, but it wouldn't keep me from ordering it again - my coworker's ginger chicken sauce looked thin as well, but she said it was still great. The tiger prawn salad had green, fresh lettuce (looked like a spring mix) and came with lots of scrimps that were  fat and juicy.  However, they listed that the salad came with crispy wontons, but her box was sans any wontons - really the only foil in the entire experience. All in all I would say it was a score. The three of us agreed that it would make a good HH spot. It's no yupha's, but certainly better than thai basil - and not a chain. Plus they were still busy, busy despite being smack in the middle of the light rail cluster fuch on central - they must be doing something right.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"}

Let's just say that the quality ingredients and enticing flavors made us feel a little less homesick. The prices were not rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portions, both of which Wild Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken. And lest I forgot alcohol - the crowning glory of any meal - the specialty drinks offered seemed like they would be too sweet or weak, so my sister and I got Cosmos.

The things that Flavors does well, Delhi Palace does so so on. And vice versa.   Where Delhi Palace shines: (within the confines of today's buffet, of course)  Palak Paneer- even though the paneer was noticeably absent or microscopic Bengan Bhartha- My eggplant-hating dining companion even liked it.  Mutter Paneer- The one dish with peas that i'll eat willingly.  The service- they weren't in your face, but they were around more than most buffet meals.  The atmosphere- it's classy without being over the top gaudy.   Where Flavors of India kicks Delhi Palace's hiney:  Naan- I prefer the flattened, nearly scorched naan to the fluffy puff that was plopped on the table here. It was fresh though, so bonus points for that.  Tandoori chicken- The flavor was fantastic, but the meat was dry.  Yellow lentil daal- I'll save my colorful description of this one and just leave it at Blech.  Curry chicken- Where's the spice? Possibly the blandest curry chicken ever.  The water- This sounds weird, but every time the server came by to refill water, we ended up with more UFOs (unidentifiable floating objects) in our glasses.   Overall, I think it's a toss-up.

Dinner is always good and the lunch buffet is not bad, either. The prices are reasonable and there is never a wait. As many times as I have been here I have never had a bad experience.

If you look at the sign on the building, it says New Hong Kong (kind of confusing when you Yelp it)  If you ask any of the old school chinese who have lived in central phoenix for the past 50 years where to get authentic home style cooking, they know it's at NHK.  If you ask the buffet community where to eat, this place is probably not on the top 100 (disclaimer:  I've never eaten the lunch buffet)  Sadly, it seems that the old school chinese community that patronize this place don't give it the Yelp reviews that it deserves, hence the low ratings.  If you're looking for traditional Cantonese style food, here's a list of semi-authentic stuff I recommend:  1) Beef chow fun 2) Tomato beef over Hong Kong style noodles 3) Fish filet over Gai Lon (Chinese broccoli) 4) Salt/pepper chicken wings (not on the menu) 5) Peking pork chops 6) West lake beef soup 7) X.O. green beans  If you want to go hard core Toi-sahn hillbilly style home cooking like poh-poh and ngain-ngain used to make:  1) Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice) 2) Foo-guah guy, Ow-see (Bitter melon chicken with black been sauce) 3) Gee-ngoke-beng (Steamed pork with preserved salty fish) 4) Hoh-yeow gai-lon (Steamed chinese brocolli with oyster sauce) 5) Bok-jom-guy (Boiled chicken with garlic and ginger sauce) 6) Muy-choi-kow-yuk (Fatty pork hot-pot with preserved vegetable) 7) Bok choy with black mushroom  Occasionally, they will bring out the compimentary house special Doang-guah gong (winter melon) or linh-gnaw gong (some sort of chinese turnip) soup.

Maybe it's a matter of taste in view of the other review on this page,  but we thought this place serves GREAT Chinese, with excellent attentive service and excellent prices, (although I'm used to LA prices and Phoenix is generally more economical across the board.)  We opted for  the fixed menu dinner, which we usually do not do, and the selections were very good.  The moo-shu pork was my favorite, although the rest of the dishes were also outstanding. There is a wonderful garlic chicken dish.  They put a little hibachi on the table so we could cook our own little skewers of beef.  We liked the very hearty soup. I did not notice any of the downside aspects noted in the other review.  The outside is not much to look at, just a rather plain free-standing building, but the interior decor is right out of the 50's, like the old style Cantonese places back then.  They play quiet Chinese music in the background, a nice touch that enhances the experience.  Plenty of parking and a bar if you like that sort of thing.  Thanks for a great evening, China Village    UDATE:  Dropped in again a few months later- just to see if the quality stayed up- and it was as good as before.
