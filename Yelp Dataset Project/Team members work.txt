The three of us divided the tasks between ourselves equally and we used to discuss our doubts with each other if we got stuck at a point. 
Task 1 was done by Ramakant and Task 2 was done by Sagar and Karteek. 
Manual evaluation was done by Sagar(human expert) and all three of us contributed to the report for our respective parts.
